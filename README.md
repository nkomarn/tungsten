a work in progress skyblock core for modded (forge) environments.

this is a sponge plugin but hooks into some forge mods for its functionality. it's also horribly incomplete, but it's a work in progress. most of the current code is either trash or doesn't work because i was trying to make a simple extension on top of botania garden of glass but ended up starting to make a fully featured skyblock core... so we'll see how that turns out.
